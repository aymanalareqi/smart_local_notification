# Audio Assets

This directory should contain sample audio files for testing the Smart Local Notification plugin.

## Required Audio Files

To fully test the example app, please add the following audio file to this directory:

1. **athan.mp3** - The default audio file used for all notification examples (recommended: 5-30 seconds)

## Audio File Requirements

- **Format**: MP3, WAV, AAC, or M4A
- **Quality**: 44.1kHz, 16-bit minimum
- **Size**: Keep files under 1MB for better performance
- **Length**: 5-30 seconds (suitable for various notification types including looping)

## Sample Audio Sources

You can find royalty-free audio files from:
- [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org)
- [Zapsplat](https://zapsplat.com)
- [Adobe Stock Audio](https://stock.adobe.com/audio)
- [YouTube Audio Library](https://studio.youtube.com)

## Testing Without Audio Files

If you don't have audio files available, the example app will still work but will show errors when trying to play audio. The notification functionality will still be demonstrated.

## File Naming Convention

Please use the exact filename "athan.mp3" for the best experience with the example app. The app is configured to use this specific file for all notification audio demonstrations.
